# Student-Data-Interpretation-and-Visualization
It is the advanced database system project which also visualizes the entered data with ease and perfection.
# Introduction
Hello guys, This is one of the best projects I've ever created using the Python programming language.It is database management system based project which is also able to visualise the data in line graph form.
# Description
Schools and Universities are the foundation of knowledge and an educational body on which students rely upon. Therefore, they need to maintain a proper database of its students to keep all the updated records and easily share information with students. Student Data Interpretation and Visualization is a console based application which manage the student's data in with help of database.
# About Project
-As mentioned above, it is a console-based system where the user has no restrictions on any features. Explaining the system, features include adding new students to a particular branch, removing students from a particular branch, finding students in a particular branch, and viewing a branch-wise list of all students.
-Important feature of this system is the visualization, it gives you a progress graph of the entire batch with all the branches.
-While adding the record of students, the user has to enter his / her name, roll number, PRN and other details then the system adds the record into the database.
-It is compiled in VS Code.
# How to run 
To run the project, you must have 'Python Interpreter' and 'Oracle' installed on your PC. You must have the 'cx_Oracle' and 'matplotlib' python modules installed to run the code. If you not have such python modules, so you should go with the pip command and install them. Then, extract the zip file from the download section. Then open the 'Student-Data-Interpretation-Visualization-main' folder. Finally, open command prompt or powershell window in that folder and run the command “python main.py”
-You must first RESET after running the code. This function creates an environment for the system i.e. it connects the system to the database and sets up the database. In the RESET function you will need to enter your Oracle database name, username and password. This information will then be stored in a permanent file so you do not need to RESET it.
